# @yolk/tool-registry

Generic host tool registration and resolution.

## What it provides

- `ToolModule<Context>` and `ToolRegistration<Context>` types.
- Tool resolution from host modules and context.
- Duplicate tool name validation.
- Adapter from resolved tools to `@yolk/agent-loop` `ToolExecutor`.

## Use it when

- A host app wants declarative tool modules with generic context.
- You need to filter/resolve tools before running the agent loop.

## Boundaries

- No app tool catalogs.
- No provider SDKs.
- Tool access is metadata; host apps enforce policy.
